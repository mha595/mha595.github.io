<h1>My Mathematical Brain</h1>
<p>I'm really good at maths, especially multiplication. 
I know what 12 multiplied by 12 minus 130 plus 6 divided by 5 multiplied by 3,000,000 divided by 12 minus 999,970 divided by 6 to the power of 11 is. 
It's 48,828,625. Your mind should be blown ;). I do like it, maths. And guess what? I'm top 1% in ICAS, maths!</p>
